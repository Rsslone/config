  "Welcome to TommyTek, this completely custom modpack is designed to have progression in the form of lightly guided tiers.   This roughly means if you want to become a god and slay everything in your wake, you need to work your way there by branching out into different mods, escape your comfort zone from time to time. This does not mean however, that you are limited into one direction all the time, there are often many ways to do something!",
